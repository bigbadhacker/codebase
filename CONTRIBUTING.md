Contributing to the Codebase library
====================================

Before you submit your pull request, please consider:
* Preserving the consistency with the style of the existing code
* Running Checstyle and Findbugs plugins with the appropriate configurations 
as described in our [Eclipse configuration reference document](https://github.com/pjcarreira/software-engineering/blob/master/eclipse-configuration/Eclipse%20Configuration%20Reference%20Guide.md).

If you have been using the Codebase and are happy with the origanization and simplicity of the code we would be 
happy to discuss any contribution you may find appropriate and would be happy to get your help.

Please provide us also with context in the pull request description and why you think that Codebase should be extended to solve a new problem.

Thank you for using Codebase.
